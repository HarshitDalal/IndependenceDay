                <h1 class="title">National Flag</h1>
                <p class="pera">The National Flag is a horizontal tricolour of India saffron (kesaria) at the top, white
                    in the middle and India green at the bottom in equal proportion. The ratio of width of the flag to
                    its length is two to three. In the centre of the white band is a navy-blue wheel with 24 equally
                    spaced spokes which represents the Ashoka Chakra.<br>The design of the National Flag was adopted by
                    the Constituent Assembly of India on 22 July 1947.

                <h1 class="title">National Animal</h1>
                <p class="pera">The magnificent tiger, Panthera tigris is a striped animal. It has a thick yellow coat
                    of fur with dark stripes. The combination of grace, strength, agility and enormous power has earned
                    the tiger its pride of place as the national animal of India. Out of eight races of the species
                    known, the Indian race, the Royal Bengal Tiger, is found throughout the country except in the
                    north-western region and also in the neighbouring countries, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. To check
                    the dwindling population of tigers in India, 'Project Tiger' was launched in April 1973. So far, 27
                    tiger reserves have been established in the country under this project, covering an area of 37,761
                    sq km.</p>

                <h1 class="title">National Bird</h1>
                <p class="pera">The Indian peacock, Pavo cristatus, the national bird of India, is a colourful,
                    swan-sized bird, with a fan-shaped crest of feathers, a white patch under the eye and a long,
                    slender neck. The male of the species is more colourful than the female, with a glistening blue
                    breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green tail of around 200 elongated feathers. The female is
                    brownish, slightly smaller than the male and lacks the tail. The elaborate courtship dance of the
                    male, fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a gorgeous sight.</p>

                <h1 class="title">National Flower</h1>
                <p class="pera">Lotus (Nelumbo Nucifera Gaertn) is the National Flower of India. It is a sacred flower
                    and occupies a unique position in the art and mythology of ancient India and has been an auspicious
                    symbol of Indian culture since time immemorial.<br>India is rich in flora. Currently available data
                    place India in the tenth position in the world and fourth in Asia in plant diversity. From about 70
                    per cent geographical area surveyed so far, 47,000 species of plants have been described by the
                    Botanical Survey of India (BSI).

                <h1 class="title">National Emblem</h1>
                <p class="pera">The State Emblem is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Asoka at Sarnath. In the
                    original, there are four lions, mounted back to back, on a circular abacus, which itself rests on a
                    bell-shaped lotus. The frieze of the abacus has sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a
                    galloping horse, a bull and a lion separated by intervening Dharma Chakras.<br>The profile of the
                    Lion Capital showing three lions mounted on the abacus with a Dharma Chakra in the centre, a bull on
                    the right and a galloping horse on the left, and outlines of Dharma Chakras on the extreme right and
                    left was adopted as the State Emblem of India on January 26, 1950. The bell-shaped lotus was
                    omitted. The motto Satyameva Jayate, which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs', written in Devanagari
                    script below the profile of the Lion Capital is part of the State Emblem of India</p>

                <h1 class="title">National Currency</h1>
                <p class="pera">The symbol of Indian Rupee typifies India's international identity for money
                    transactions and economic strength. The Indian Rupee sign is an allegory of Indian ethos. The symbol
                    is an amalgam of Devanagari "Ra" and the Roman Capital "R" with two parallel horizontal stripes
                    running at the top representing the national flag and also the "equal to" sign. The Indian Rupee
                    sign was adopted by the Government of India on 15th July, 2010.<br>The symbol, conceptualised and
                    designed by Udaya Kumar, a post graduate in Design from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, has
                    been chosen from thousands of concept entries received by the Ministry of Finance through an open
                    competition among resident Indian nationals. The process of establishing and implementing this new
                    identity is underway through various digital technology and computer applications.

                    <br><br>
                    Dates of the national calendar have a permanent correspondence with dates of the Gregorian calendar,
                    1 Chaitra falling on 22 March normally and on 21 March in leap year.

                <p>India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural
                    heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since Independence. As the 7th largest
                    country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and
                    the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in
                    the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean
                    between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.</p>
